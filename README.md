Social Media App
A basic social media app where you can create posts and view a feed. Built this with React on the frontend and Node/Express on the backend, with MongoDB for the database and ImageKit for handling image uploads.
What it does

Create posts (with images)
View a feed of posts

That's pretty much it for now.
Tech used

Frontend – React + Vite
Backend – Node.js, Express
Database – MongoDB (via Mongoose)
Image uploads – ImageKit

Running it locally
You'll need Node.js and MongoDB set up.
Backend
bashcd backend
npm install
# add a .env file with your MongoDB URI and ImageKit credentials
node server.js
Frontend
bashcd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173, backend on port 3000.
.env stuff
The backend needs these in a .env file:
MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_uri
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=...
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=...
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=...
